    <div>
	  <p>Welcome! This is by far the much more interesting part of my webpage. Let's be honest, you've probably seen dozens of resumes by now so by the time you got to mine you were probably tired of them. But now I offer you something that no other project has done before! What could it be, you ask? That's right, this is the ONLY CS1520 webpage that talks about me, Matt Snyder. [*Note: IF another CS1520 webpage has this info about me, please let me, and probably the authorities, know about it ASAP, because that'd mean there is a serious case of stalking going on and that's not cool.*]</p>
	  
	  <p>Most people, when they meet someone new, ask them what their job is or what they're studying in school. Why must we be so boring! If they're not in my classes or my line of work, then they probably wouldn't be interested in what I have to say if I explain it at a level the average person could understand, but if I talked about all the intracacies that make me so fond of my study, they also wouldn't have a clue what I'm talking about. So let me tell you about my hobbies and interests that make me relateable to the rest of humanity.</p>
	  
	  <h2>Hobbies<h2>
	    <h3>Fencing</h3>
		  <p>No, not the act of building lawn enclosures, but the old sport of fighting with swords. There are three weapon styles in fencing, foil, epee, and sabre, but I really only fence sabre. I like sabre in particular because it is fast and requires quick thinking and quick reactions, and you are allowed to make cuts and slashes instead of just stabs and thrusts like in epee and foil. I tried doing kendo for awhile, and it was fun, but since I'm flat-footed and kendo requires you to be barefoot, sadly, we weren't made for each other.</p>
		  
		<h3>Wood Carving/Whittlin'</h3>
		  <p>It started off as a way to pass the hours at Scout Camp between when I'd wake up in the morning and when everyone else would wake up (I used to be a really early riser). After I developed some rather fine motor control and a sense of art, I started to try and make animals and whatnot. To date, I don't have a lot of pieces that I'd consider great, but its something I plan to develop over the rest of my life, so I'm not concerned about the progress.</p>
		
		<h3>Throwing Knives</h3>
		
		  <p class="floatLeft">Another hobby that I picked up over the years is target throwing knives. When I turned 18 my two best friends (I basically grew up with them, we've known each other since the first grade) gifted me a set of small throwing knives, and I was instantly enamored. I practice whenever I'm home (I can't exactly have them on campus) and I've gotten a lot better with time. I think my accuracy rate is well over 70%, but it's been a few months so I'm not sure if that's correct or not. Now, I don't want to delude you, throwing knives in real life are not at all like what you see in video games like Call of Duty. You can not throw one across the map (hundreds of feet in reality) and hit your target point-on everytime. After 15-20 feet your ability to accurately throw decreases dramatically due to physics (who knew!) since the Earth's gravity pulls the blade down causing it to spin. If games like COD were scientifically accurate, you'd miss 50% of the time you threw at long range because you'd hit your opponent with the handle of the knife instead of the blade - but I digress. You've probably noticed a trend by now, I tend to like activities that are sharp and slightly medieval, but never fear, I enjoy other things as well.</p>

		<h3>Games</h3>
		  <p id="games">I also like all sorts of games. Video games, board games, card games, tabletop games. You name it, and if it involves friends I'll probably play it. When it comes to video games I really enjoy MOBAs (Massive Online Battle Arenas), like League of Legends, Adventure RPGs and strategy games. I use to play League pretty often, but lately I've been beta-testing a new MOBA called Paragon, which offers a cross between the classic MOBA and a 3rd person shooter, with some new twists like a 3-dimensional layout in lanes and jungle. I like strategy games whether they are RTS (Real Time Strategy) like Star Wars: Empire At War, or are turn based like the Fire Emblem series. When it comes to Fire Emblem, which introduced the concept of perma-death (that is, when a character dies in battle, they can't come back in later battles) to many in the video game industry, I challenge myself to find a way to win every battle without a single casualty. I also like the morie classic RPGs like Pokemon, Legend of Zelda and MegaMan Battle Network. When it comes to non-video games, I'm down to playing pretty much anything if I can hang out with my friends. Recently some friends had me play Dungeons and Dragons with them, which I was hesitant to join, but it ended up being rather fun.</p>
		
		<h3>Reading</h3>
		  <p>A hobby that I have when I want to be alone is reading. I do enjoy a well written book, though I tend to get lost in them. Not in a bad way, mind you, I have a very active imagination so when I pick up a book and start reading it, I tend to see and feel what's happening in the book. Usually I'll start a book, then look up and notice a lot more time has passed than I intended. Because of this I can't really afford any leisure reading while I'm busy at college since they prove to be such absorbing distractions. When I do get the chance to read, I'm quite the avid reader, and will read hundreds of pages in one sitting. In my senior year of high school, I read Les Miserables, well over a thousand pages, over a two week period, all during my first period class (to be fair, it was Chorus, we didn't do much). My favorite author is Ted Dekker, who writes really good thrillers and fantasies that make you do a lot of thinking about life. He incorporates a lot of psychological topics in his stories, like Three, a novel about a guy, his best friend, and a serial bomber. You follow the action from the point of view of an FBI agent in charge of the bombing case and (*spoiler warning*) you find out that the guy, his friend, and the bomber are actually the same person suffering from Multiple Personality Disorder. It was such a gripping story, that when that twist was revealed I placed a bookmark where I was and proceeded to go back through the previous chapters and find all the clues that pointed to that reality. It was astounding.</p>

		  <h3>Cooking:</h3>
		    <p>One last hobby that I want to mention is cooking. Making food is pretty important to me, not only because it keeps me alive and well, but it is also a really easy way to do something nice for the people you care about. My interest in cooking started when I began living by myself for college and while on co-op, so I guess you could say it was spawned from neccessity, but grew into a passion. I like making dishes that are cooked in frying pans and woks. I can make a killer, ad-hoc stirfry from whatever is in the fridge, but I also like learning how to prepare "named" dishes like Yakiudon (Japanese noodle stirfry with beef and bean sprouts) and Bulgogi (Korean BBQ served with kimchi and rice). I had planned on expanding into baked goods this semester, but the apartment that I moved into has a sub-par oven. What I mean by this is that on the knobs to control the stovetop and oven temperature, there is only a mark for where the off setting is, there are no temperature marks on either the stove knobs or the oven knob. My roommate and I have been able to deduce which section of the stove knobs are Low, Medium, and High, but we don't want to gamble with the oven temperatures. So instead of baking I decided to try out deep-frying with my wok. So far I have made Vegetable Tempura (deep-fried vegetables in a light, fluffy batter) and Deep-fried Oreos (a staple of the county/state fair). The best thing about cooking is that I can do something nice for my friends and family. By watching them sit down and enjoy something delicious that I made myself brings me great joy.</p>
