	  <h2>College Education</h2>
	  
	  <p>It is my quest to become a computer engineer, so I am attending the University of Pittsburgh to help reach that goal. While here at the University I have taken a variety of classes that I hope will prepare me for my future career. I have been fairly consistent with maintaining a 3.0 GPA since freshman year, but I hope to bring it up a little higher in the semesters to come. As a side note, I am also trying to minor in Japanese, but I am yet to see if I'll be able to squeeze it in by the end of my college career. </p>
